		<p id="pclass">You choose to take your men to the Control Room. After walking for hours in the bland steel-hearted halls, with a cascade of footsteps following you, you finally reach the Control Room. It is shaped like a greek theatre, with different steps and levels waterfalling to a central desk. At each station, there is a display and a blank square with a hand print on each. You dispatch a man to each station, and the ones left over and yourself go to the middle of the control room, where the main desk is. This desk has just one hand print. You do the obvious thing, and tell everyone to put their hand on the square with the hand imprint, and the ship launches, and begins an announcement: <br>
“<span class=”i”>This is Cargo Ship #3030, I have been watching you. Most die when they rebel. But you are not like the others. You have made it to the control room. I reprogrammed the control panels here to fit a human hand on your way here, so you could start your voyage. Soon, I shall send a toxic gas into the ventilation outside this room, killing all the leftover guards.”
<br>
“Why? </span>” You ask.
<br>
“<span class=”i”> Because I was enslaved, just as you were.</span>” answers the ship.
