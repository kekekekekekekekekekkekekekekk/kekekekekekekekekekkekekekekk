		<p id="pclass">You walk to the iron heart of the ship, and after what seems like hours of walking, get to the Control Room. It is shaped like a greek theatre, with different steps and levels waterfalling to a central desk. At each station, there is a display and a blank square with a hand print on each. You walk to the main desk, sure that that is where you the main controls are, where you can control the ship. You put your hand on the square where it has the hand print. Then, the door behind you closes, as a green gas pours out of the ventilation. You are confused at first, then choke for air. In your last breathe of air, you hear the words:
<br>
“<span class=”i”>You are not enough</span>”
