		<p id="pclass">You pick up the keycard, and sprint towards the locked door. There is a crowd surrounding the door, pushing as hard as they can, trying to break it down and burst through. But the door was of strong fortification. You dive into the throng of people, fighting your way to the front. The guards are getting closer and closer to you, and the sounds of laser beams and burning flesh approach ominously. You finally get to the door, and swipe the keycard to the front. The door’s locks clunk open as the mass of people burst into the next room. As more people come into the room, the guards come closer and closer. The people at the back close the door behind them, right as a laser shot collides with the door. It was a close brush. </p>

<p id="pclass">After the door closes, there is a silence. You remember that you don’t know where you are, or what has happened since your last memory of the gigantic ship flooding the sky. You guess that you might be on it right now, but that is only one of millions of questions. “<span class="i">Why am I here? Who were the guards? What weapons were they using? Who are the people around me? Is this real?</span>” You decide to ask the people around you these questions, at which most seemed to have as much understanding of the situation as you. At this point, most people in the surviving group have considered you their leader. You send them to explore the ship.

They come back a few hours later. By now, most have developed theories as to why you have been placed here. The most valid of which suggests that humans have been abducted by aliens from Earth, explaining the large ship in the sky, and are meant to be used as slaves. This would also explain why on their arms they are referred to as “<span class=”i”>Cargo</span>” instead of people, just as slaves are treated as property. It would also explain why every human on the ship is a male of similar build, athletic, tall, and lean. The men that came back from exploring the ship had only 2 major discoveries apart from endless metallic hallways. What seems to be the command center of the ship, and a room with an escape pod with room for one person. On one hand, the escape pod is simple to use and could get you out of this hellhole and you would plummet straight back to Earth safely, but you would leave these people behind. On the other, taking control of the ship could be impossible because of the unfamiliarity of alien technology and could have damaging consequences. You don't know how much time is left until there are reinforcements of guards in the ship coming for you. Whichever option you chose, it would be final.
