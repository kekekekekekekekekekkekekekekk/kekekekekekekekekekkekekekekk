		<p id="pclass">Red light invades the room around you. Alarms screech. Outside you here blasts of what you assume are some kind of laser weapons, as the cries of the wounded act as a snare to the conflict's beat. You look around you, you see a metallic cocoon engulfing you, as you feel the frigid cold. You guess it must be a cryogenic cell, but you've only seen those in Sci-Fi movies. '<span class="i">What's going on?</span>' you think. The last thing you remember is looking out your window to a ship miles and miles long, and screaming everywhere. You look down, noticing you are wearing thin gray fatigues. You try to break out of the pod, as the conflict's immense noise drowns out your thoughts. As you push against the door, you notice something on your arm. A mark, a tattoo of somesort, but different. Instead of being ink, it seems live, as if a plant had woven itself into your forearm. It read '<span class="i">Cargo #5321</span>'. At, that moment, you burst through the door.</p>

<p id="pclass">As you step out, you are enveloped in pure conflict. Lasers blast by you, leaving blistering heat waves. The sound is deafening. You are surrounded by an ensemble of people, all wearing the same uniform. They are sprinting towards the end of the hall, as screams cry behind them. You start running as well. You notice everyone around you is a male of similar stature. As if you were chosen to be here. As alarms blare, you pass a collapsed form lying on the ground. Not a human, but something different, some other species, but not something you've seen before.  As you look closer, you see it has a keycard around its neck and some sort of weapon. You check ahead, into the hallway, seing a locked door, and then behind you, where you see a multitude of what you presume to be the things attacking your people. You make the decision to either grab the keycard or the weapon.</p>
