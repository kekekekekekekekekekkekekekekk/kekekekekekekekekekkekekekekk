		<p id="pclass">You chose the weapon. It is lighter than you expected for its size.  It looks like a crab’s claw, but larger, around the size of an actual crab. On the back there are no buttons, or anything like a trigger. The same goes for the entire weapon. But it doesn’t seem like a melee weapon, nothing on it is sharp, and it isn’t really convenient to swing around. A laser shears past you, leaving your ears ringing. You remember that you are being shot at, and instinctively point your newly acquired weapon in the direction of the shot, without looking. If you were trained in combat, you would have looked where you were aiming, and would’ve figured out what the thing you are holding actually is before using it as a gun. But by some baffling stroke of luck, you hit a button on the right side of the weapon as you were pointing it. This button triggered the gun, which was much more powerful than you expected it to be, shooting a fusion beam at the direction of the attackers. This beam exuded colossal amounts of energy, causing a huge explosion. Blast waves rushed towards you at an unbounded pace, but the weapon must have been built for this kind of scenario, because right before the blast waves reached you and swathed you with heat, energy, and radiation, the weapon deployed a kind of force field, that surrounded you, making a small sphere around you. The eruption went over your aegis, going past you and incinerating all of the people behind you. And in a fraction of a second, it was all over. Your safeguard was still deployed, which was also most likely by design because the walls of the long metal halls of the place around you were now red hot. You could move, and it was now as if you were alone on the here. The blast wave must have gone on for miles and miles, with how it was so powerful. This would mean that you would not have to worry about guards for the time being, but you are sure there are some left in the in the steel labyrinth around you. You sprint into the cavernous halls. After what feels like days of running through monotone greys and blacks, you reach a sign. It reads “<span class=”i”>Escape Pod</span”, with another arrow pointing further into the entanglement of halls, reading “<span class=”i”>Control Room</span>”. If there is an escape pod here, it must mean that you are in some kind of space ship, maybe the one you saw last that stretched from horizon to horizon across the sky. You decide whether to go to the Control Room, or to use this Escape Pod.</p>
