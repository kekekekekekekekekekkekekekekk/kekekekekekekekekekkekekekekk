		<h1 class="mainheader">Escape in Escape Pod</h1>
		<p id="pclass">You choose the Escape Pod. While it may be selfish, it is the most surefire way to ensure your safety and your best chance of finding out what has truly happened, and how to survive from then on. If you had chosen to go to the control room, most likely you would never take control of the ship, and if you had, who knows how many guards would still be on here, not to mention how many ships this alien species would send in retaliation to you commandeering this one. So you tell everyone else to go to the control room, and lag behind them until they turn a couple corners. At this point, you sprint in the direction of where one of the men said the escape pod was, and after a few minutes of all out running, you find it. You unlatch the door, leap inside, close the door, and frantically look for the control panel. You look everywhere, trying to find the controls to it. By this point, the men you left behind must know what you have done, and could be coming any second. You search everywhere, not finding a control panel anywhere. A mass of enraged men burst into the room. They bang on the door to the escape pod, but the metal is too strong. Just then, you find that the escape pod only activates when you get really, really, mad. The tattoo on your arm must measure certain chemicals in the blood, as a way to make sure all the “Cargo” are at a stable physical state. It must communicate with the escape pod, because only as soon as you screamed for it to go, scared as you could possibly be, when at that moment your adrenaline and cortisol spiked, is when the escape pod detached, leaving behind the ship, plummeting back to Earth.
